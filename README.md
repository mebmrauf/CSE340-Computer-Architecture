# CSE340: Computer Architecture

<p>A systematic study of the various elements in computer design, including circuit design, storage mechanisms, addressing schemes, and various approaches to parallelism and distributed logic. Information representation and transfer; instruction and data access methods; the control unit; hardware and microprogrammed; memory organisation. RISC and CSEC machines.</p>

## Course Objectives

a) Introduce different processor technologies, performance metrics, representation of numbers, and arithmetic operations. Introduce MIPS architecture, demonstrate its instruction formats, and translation of simple C/Java code snippets to MIPS assembly language.

b) Teach how to design processor datapaths, recognize pipelining hazards, and use different techniques to overcome them.

c) Introduce and explain memory hierarchy and performance analysis.

d) Introduce parallel architecture and parallel programming.
